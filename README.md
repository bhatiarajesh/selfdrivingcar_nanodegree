Itâ€™s not about the pieces but how they work together. The objective of the final project was to create code with a team to drive a vehicle in both a Unity-based simulator and a real-world Lincoln MKZ around a closed-circuit test-track. This repository contains all ROS nodes to implement the core functionality of an autonomous vehicle system.
